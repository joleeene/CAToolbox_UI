# MayaToolbox
For CA 2023 only.

This script is intended to solve annoying Maya problems. The reason why not a plugin is because admin is needed to install a plugin in lab.
Python 3.0+ based.

# HOW TO USE THIS
Download this to your storage, open the script in Maya but before you run it,
modify the ui_file_path in Path.py first. Let it point to the .ui file in your directory.

# HOW TO UPDATE
Just copy everything in CAToolbox_UI_src.py and paste in your local file.
And replace the .ui file.
