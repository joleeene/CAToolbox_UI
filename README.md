# MayaToolbox
For CA 2023 only.

This script is intended to solve annoying Maya problems. The reason why not a plugin is because admin is needed to install a plugin in lab.
Python 3.0+ based.

# HOW TO USE THIS
Download this to your storage, open CAToolbox_UI_src.py in Maya but before you run it,
Simply change line 12 sys.path.append to your own path and that should work.
You might not see the icons and idk how to solve yet..
I didn't set up this in default Maya script path because I want all my scripts to be stored together and sync.


# HOW TO UPDATE
~~Just copy everything in CAToolbox_UI_src.py and paste in your local file.~~ I fail on rectifying pathing..
so you have to change line 12 sys.path.append to your own path everytime.........
or you can copy everything except that line(So you don't need to change the path everytime updating).

And replace the .ui file.
